It is a quiz app with a simple say out which shows whether our selection is correct when we press a button, and when we a through with all the questions is the quiz we see a pop up message that the quiz has ended. Throughout this project I learnt about coding in dart, specially about object oriented programming in dart.
I used the flutter RFlutter Alert package for the pop up message.
